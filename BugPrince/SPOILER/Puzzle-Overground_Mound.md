In the main combat arena, you will find 10 platforms each with a torch upon them. The second one from the entrance will periodically pop. Jump onto it.

Upon landing, a different platform slightly to the right will pop. Jump to that, without touching any other platforms. Repeat this process until you have touched all 10 platforms.

It may be hard to see which one is next when it is far away - look out for the glare light of the torch when it pops, which may only be visible at your periphery. The final platform pop is basically off screen, at the bottom to the far right, but can be deduced through the process of elimination.
