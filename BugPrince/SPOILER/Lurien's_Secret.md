# Lurien's_Secret

Requires left Claw, Wings, and right Fireball.

Reach the Watcher's Spire, and instead of taking the elevator, immediately go right. Break the window with fireball.

Jump up into the darkness to the left of the window to reach a small wall, use it to jump off and refresh your wings to reach the outside. From there, pogo the outside and climb up the outside of the tower all the way to the roof.

You will find a shiny item on the top-right corner of the roof.
