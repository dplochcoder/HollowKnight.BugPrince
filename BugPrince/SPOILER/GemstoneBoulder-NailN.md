# GemstoneBoulder-NailN

To reach the Gemstone Cavern, head to upper right Crystal Peak as if making your way to Crystal Heart. Instead of dropping down the shafts to the lever, go past the large crystal crawler and break the wall behind them.

You'll need some movement to get over the crystal pit, then keep going right until you reach the crystal boulder.

The boulder contains at least 4 items, respectively named Nail0, Nail1, Nail2, and Nail3. Acquiring each one requires striking the boulder with your nail upgraded to the titular level.
