In the large open room to the right of the Shaman, you will find a linear array of 5 or 6 hanging lanterns. These can be struck with the nail to 'pop'.

On the central platform high above the Baldur arena, you will likewise find a linear array of 5 or 6 torches. Every few seconds, these torches will pop one after the other in a determined sequence. Memorize this sequence, and get good at it! The pattern is randomized based on the generation seed.

Once you've memorized it, go back to the hanging lanterns and strike them in the same order. Upon the last strike, a hidden check will appear.
