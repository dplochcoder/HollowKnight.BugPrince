# Hidden_Perch-Lake_of_Unn

Reaching this hidden relic requires Claw, Crystal Heart, and Wings.

First, CDash to the left wall over the Lake of Unn.  Wall jump up as high as possible to set up another CDash just under the Aluba.

Cancel this second CDash just before the right side entrance, and wings upwards; if done correctly, you will briefly be able to wall cling. Jump/dash outwards and wings up again to keep climing, to a few heights below the ceiling.

From there, CDash left again. You'll find a small platform there with an item on it.
