# Challenge-Crystallized_Mound

Requires access to Crystallized Mound, and a bunch of movement.

Enter Crystallized Mound normally, then strike the lantern 3 times. This makes all the enemies and platforms disappear.

Use CDash + Claw + Wings to reach the first climb where the crawler normally is, without platforms.

In the next section, look carefully in the crystals below for shiny markers. These are where the crystals are most prominent and can be pogo'd. Make your way to the right-most marker, then do a precise wings+dash left to pogo off the spikes by the next ledge. From there you can easily pogo your way up to the top and reach Descending Dark.

After a couple seconds, the check will appear to the left of the crystallized Shaman.
