# UpperGem-GemstoneCavern

To reach the Gemstone Cavern, head to upper right Crystal Peak as if making your way to Crystal Heart. Instead of dropping down the shafts to the lever, go past the large crystal crawler and break the wall behind them.

Once inside, immediately CDash to the right, without dropping even one step. It is just high enough to reach a ledge at the far side of the cavern without any vertical. There, you will find an extra check.
